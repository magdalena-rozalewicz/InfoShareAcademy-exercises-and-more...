## Magdalena Rozalewicz
I'm aspiring to be a junior front-end developer - JavaScript/ React. \
I am a creative and hard working person who strives for excellence in everything I do. \
I am currently working with my colleagues from the academy on another SPA project - CookBook is an application that presents recipes and allows you to comment on them and add your own.\

 You can also click here:  [CookBook](https://infoshareacademy.github.io/jfdzr7-team-devs/)  to live preview.\
 
## Project is created with:\
⭐ React (styled components, hooks, react context, react router)\
⭐ Material UI
⭐ JavaScript
⭐ Firebase (Firestore, Authenticaton, Storage)
⭐ HTML
⭐ CSS
