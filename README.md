## Magdalena Rozalewicz ## \
I'm aspiring to be a junior front-end developer - JavaScript/ React. \
I am a creative and hard working person who strives for excellence in everything I do. \
I am currently working with my colleagues from the academy on another project - an application that presents recipes and allows you to comment on them and add your own.
